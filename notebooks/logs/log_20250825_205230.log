  For highly secure, air-gapped deployments (with no internet egress), Fiddler typically recommends:

  - Ensuring all required compute resources (CPU, memory, storage) are provisioned locally.
  - Configuring internal networking so that all Fiddler services can communicate without external dependencies.
  - Setting up local logging and prompt/response storage, often via mounted volumes or internal databases.
  - Disabling or redirecting any telemetry or update checks to prevent outbound network calls.

  It appears there was an error retrieving the relevant documentation for your request regarding detailed air-gapped Kubernetes installation steps for Fiddler Guardrails and LLM monitoring, including offline image handling, compute requirements, private registry setup, and offline Trust Model/PII dictionary updates.
  
  Because I cannot access the authoritative Fiddler documentation at this moment, I cannot provide the exact, step-by-step instructions you requested.
