  ## Tamper-Evident Audit Trails in Fiddler
  
  Fiddler's platform is designed for enterprise-grade model monitoring, including LLM and traditional ML models. Key audit trail features typically include:
  
  - **Timestamps**: Every event (model inference, moderation, user action) is timestamped for traceability.
  - **Requester Identity**: User and service identities are logged for each action, supporting accountability.
  - **Prompt/Response Fingerprints or Hashes**: For LLM monitoring and Guardrails, Fiddler can capture hashed representations of prompts and responses to ensure privacy while enabling auditability.
  - **Moderation Scores/Reasons**: Trust and safety guardrails log moderation outcomes, including scores and reasons for any flagged content.

  I'm unable to retrieve the exact Fiddler documentation at this moment due to a temporary technical issue accessing the secure documentation bundle. As a result, I cannot provide direct links or extract the precise audit log schema, verification process, or the full list of API/SDK endpoints and SageMaker-native configuration steps from Fiddler's official resources right now.
  
  **What I recommend:**
  - Visit the Fiddler documentation portal directly at [https://docs.fiddler.ai/](https://docs.fiddler.ai/) and search for terms such as "audit log schema," "Guardrails monitoring," "LLM monitoring," "API endpoints," "SageMaker deployment," "IAM roles," "VPC endpoints," and "S3 export."
  - For highly detailed compliance requirements (e.g., cryptographically signed, append-only logs with WORM retention), contact Fiddler support or your Fiddler technical account manager for the most current and authoritative implementation guides.
  
  **Typical Documentation Sections to Look For:**
  - **Audit Logging & Security**: Usually details the schema (fields like timestamp, request ID, user/service principal, hashes, moderation scores, policy versions, actions, model lineage) and verification (signing, immutability).
  - **API/SDK Reference**: Lists endpoints for log retrieval/export.
  - **AWS SageMaker Deployment Guide**: Covers IAM roles/policies, VPC endpoints, S3 Object Lock/WORM, and data residency best practices.

        ## Tamper-Evident Audit Trails in Fiddler
        
        Fiddler's platform is designed for enterprise-grade model monitoring, including LLM and traditional ML models. Key audit trail features typically include:
        
        - **Timestamps**: Every event (model inference, moderation, user action) is timestamped for traceability.
        - **Requester Identity**: User and service identities are logged for each action, supporting accountability.
        - **Prompt/Response Fingerprints or Hashes**: For LLM monitoring and Guardrails, Fiddler can capture hashed representations of prompts and responses to ensure privacy while enabling auditability.
        - **Moderation Scores/Reasons**: Trust and safety guardrails log moderation outcomes, including scores and reasons for any flagged content.

        It appears there was a temporary issue retrieving the specific documentation needed to answer your detailed compliance and audit trail question. However, based on Fiddler AI's standard product architecture and common industry practices, I can outline the typical tamper-evident audit trail capabilities and deployment options relevant to your scenario:
        
        ## Tamper-Evident Audit Trails in Fiddler
        
        Fiddler's platform is designed for enterprise-grade model monitoring, including LLM and traditional ML models. Key audit trail features typically include:
        
        - **Timestamps**: Every event (model inference, moderation, user action) is timestamped for traceability.
        - **Requester Identity**: User and service identities are logged for each action, supporting accountability.
        - **Prompt/Response Fingerprints or Hashes**: For LLM monitoring and Guardrails, Fiddler can capture hashed representations of prompts and responses to ensure privacy while enabling auditability.
        - **Moderation Scores/Reasons**: Trust and safety guardrails log moderation outcomes, including scores and reasons for any flagged content.

  AIMessage {
      content: """
        I'm unable to retrieve the exact Fiddler documentation at this moment due to a temporary technical issue accessing the secure documentation bundle. As a result, I cannot provide direct links or extract the precise audit log schema, verification process, or the full list of API/SDK endpoints and SageMaker-native configuration steps from Fiddler's official resources right now.
        
        **What I recommend:**
        - Visit the Fiddler documentation portal directly at [https://docs.fiddler.ai/](https://docs.fiddler.ai/) and search for terms such as "audit log schema," "Guardrails monitoring," "LLM monitoring," "API endpoints," "SageMaker deployment," "IAM roles," "VPC endpoints," and "S3 export."
        - For highly detailed compliance requirements (e.g., cryptographically signed, append-only logs with WORM retention), contact Fiddler support or your Fiddler technical account manager for the most current and authoritative implementation guides.
        
        **Typical Documentation Sections to Look For:**
        - **Audit Logging & Security**: Usually details the schema (fields like timestamp, request ID, user/service principal, hashes, moderation scores, policy versions, actions, model lineage) and verification (signing, immutability).
        - **API/SDK Reference**: Lists endpoints for log retrieval/export.
        - **AWS SageMaker Deployment Guide**: Covers IAM roles/policies, VPC endpoints, S3 Object Lock/WORM, and data residency best practices.
