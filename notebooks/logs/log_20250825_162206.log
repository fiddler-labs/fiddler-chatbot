        - **Dashboard Creation:** Use Fiddler‚Äôs dashboard feature to create a new dashboard. Add widgets for:

  ## 1. Auto-Including Newly Onboarded Models & LLM Apps
  
  - **Projects & Tags:**  
    - Fiddler allows you to group models and LLM apps using projects or tags.  
    - When onboarding a new model (including those from multiple SageMaker accounts/regions), assign it to a designated project (e.g., ‚ÄúOrg-Wide Monitoring‚Äù) or apply standardized tags (e.g., ‚Äúorg_dashboard‚Äù).
    - Dashboards can be configured to automatically include all models/apps within a project or with specific tags, ensuring new onboarded assets are included without manual updates.
