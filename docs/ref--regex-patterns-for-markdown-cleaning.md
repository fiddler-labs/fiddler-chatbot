## 1. YAML Metadata Cleaning

### Purpose

Clean YAML front matter in markdown files to retain only essential fields: `title`, `excerpt`, and `metadata.description`, while removing all other fields like `slug`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `layout`, etc.

### Final Refined Pattern

**Search Pattern:**

```regex
^\n(title: [^\n]*)\n(?:(?!excerpt:).*\n)*(excerpt: >-(?:\n  [^\n]*)*)\n(?:(?!metadata:)(?!).*\n)*(?:(metadata:\n  description: >-(?:\n    [^\n]*)*)\n)?(?:(?!).*\n)*
```

**Replace Pattern:**

```yaml

$1
$2
$3

```

### Pattern Breakdown

1. **`^\n`** - Matches the opening `---` separator line
2. **`(title: [^\n]*)`** - Captures the entire title line in capture group 1
   - `title:` matches the literal text
   - `[^\n]*` matches any characters except newline (the title content)
3. **`(?:(?!excerpt:).*\n)*`** - Skips lines between title and excerpt
   - `(?!excerpt:)` negative lookahead ensures we stop at "excerpt:"
   - `.*\n` matches complete lines
4. **`(excerpt: >-(?:\n  [^\n]*)*)`** - Captures the multiline excerpt in capture group 2
   - `excerpt: >-` matches the YAML multiline indicator
   - `(?:\n  [^\n]*)*` matches indented lines (2 spaces)
5. **`(?:(?!metadata:)(?!).*\n)*`** - Skips lines until metadata or end
   - Stops at either "metadata:" or the closing `---`
6. **`(?:(metadata:\n  description: >-(?:\n    [^\n]*)*)\n)?`** - Optionally captures metadata
   - The entire metadata block is optional with `(?:...)?`
   - Captures in group 3 when present
   - Handles 4-space indentation for description content
7. **`(?:(?!).*\n)*`** - Matches remaining lines until closing separator

### Example Transformations

**Input with metadata:**

```yaml

title: Uploading model artifacts
slug: uploading-model-artifacts
excerpt: >-
  This document provides instructions on how to upload a model artifact into
  Fiddler by creating the model and updating the artifact.
metadata:
  description: >-
    This document provides instructions on how to upload a model artifact into
    Fiddler by creating the model and updating the artifact.
  image: []
  robots: index
createdAt: Fri Apr 05 2024 12:04:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
updatedAt: Fri Apr 19 2024 13:25:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

```

**Output:**

```yaml

title: Uploading model artifacts
excerpt: >-
  This document provides instructions on how to upload a model artifact into
  Fiddler by creating the model and updating the artifact.
metadata:
  description: >-
    This document provides instructions on how to upload a model artifact into
    Fiddler by creating the model and updating the artifact.

```

**Input without metadata:**

```yaml

title: Publishing production data
slug: publishing-production-data
excerpt: >-
  Navigate our client guide to publishing production data.
hidden: false

```

**Output:**

```yaml

title: Publishing production data
excerpt: >-
  Navigate our client guide to publishing production data.

```

### Key Features

- Handles both cases: with and without metadata/description
- Preserves multiline YAML formatting with proper indentation
- Uses negative lookaheads to properly identify section boundaries
- Maintains the YAML document separators (`---`)

## 2. GitBook Asset Image Removal

### Purpose

Remove markdown image links that reference GitBook assets folder, typically used for screenshots and diagrams that aren't needed in the corpus.

### Final Refined Pattern

**Search Pattern:**

```regex
!\[.*?\]\((?:\.\.\/)*\.gitbook\/assets\/[^)]+\)
```

**Replace Pattern:** (empty - to completely remove)

### Pattern Breakdown

1. **`!\[.*?\]`** - Matches the markdown image syntax
   - `!` identifies this as an image (not a regular link)
   - `\[` and `\]` are escaped square brackets
   - `.*?` matches any alt text (non-greedy)
2. **`\(`** - Escaped opening parenthesis for the URL
3. **`(?:\.\.\/)*`** - Matches any number of parent directory references
   - `\.\.\/` matches "../" (dots and slash are escaped)
   - `*` allows zero or more occurrences
   - `(?:...)` makes it a non-capturing group
4. **`\.gitbook\/assets\/`** - The specific GitBook assets path
   - Dots are escaped to match literal periods
5. **`[^)]+`** - Matches the filename
   - `[^)]` matches any character except closing parenthesis
   - `+` requires at least one character
6. **`\)`** - Escaped closing parenthesis

### Example Matches

- `![](../../.gitbook/assets/2b19cf0-Screen_Shot_2023-12-19_at_2.31.43_PM.png)`
- `![Screenshot](.gitbook/assets/dashboard.png)`
- `![](../../../.gitbook/assets/model-upload-flow.jpg)`

### Variations and Edge Cases

The pattern handles:

- Empty alt text or alt text with content
- Multiple levels of parent directory navigation
- Any filename format within the assets folder
- Special characters in filenames (underscores, hyphens, etc.)

## 3. GitBook Include Statement Removal

### Purpose

Remove Liquid template include statements that reference GitBook includes folder, typically used for shared content blocks like headers and footers.

### Final Refined Pattern (VS Code Compatible)

**Search Pattern:**

```regex
{%.*\.gitbook\/includes\/.*%}
```

**Replace Pattern:** (empty - to completely remove)

### Alternative Patterns (For Different Regex Engines)

**More Specific Pattern (if VS Code supports):**

```regex
{%[ ]*include[ ]*"(?:\.\.\/)*\.gitbook\/includes\/[^"]*"[ ]*%}
```

**Original Pattern (may cause issues in some editors):**

```regex
{%\s*include\s*"(?:\.\.\/)*\.gitbook\/includes\/[^"]+"\s*%}
```

### Pattern Breakdown (Simplified Version)

1. **`{%`** - Opening Liquid template markers
2. **`.*`** - Any characters (includes "include", spaces, quotes)
3. **`\.gitbook\/includes\/`** - The specific GitBook includes path
4. **`.*`** - Any characters until the end
5. **`%}`** - Closing template markers

### Pattern Breakdown (Detailed Version)

1. **`{%`** - Opening Liquid template markers
2. **`[ ]*`** - Zero or more spaces
   - Using explicit space character class instead of `\s` for compatibility
3. **`include`** - The literal word "include"
4. **`[ ]*`** - More optional spaces
5. **`"`** - Opening quote for the file path
6. **`(?:\.\.\/)*`** - Zero or more parent directory references
7. **`\.gitbook\/includes\/`** - The GitBook includes path
8. **`[^"]*`** - Any characters except quotes (the filename)
9. **`"`** - Closing quote
10. **`[ ]*`** - Optional trailing spaces
11. **`%}`** - Closing template markers

### Example Matches

- `{% include "../.gitbook/includes/main-doc-dev-footer.md" %}`
- `{%include ".gitbook/includes/header.md"%}`
- `{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/shared/navigation.html" %}`

### VS Code Compatibility Notes

The simplified pattern `{%.*\.gitbook\/includes\/.*%}` is recommended for VS Code because:

- It avoids the "lone quantifier brackets" error
- It's more forgiving of syntax variations
- It's easier to understand and maintain

## 4. Usage Instructions

### In VS Code

1. **Open Search and Replace:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac)
   - Or use Find â†’ Replace in Files from the menu

2. **Enable Regex Mode:**
   - Click the `.*` button in the search box
   - Or press `Alt+R` to toggle regex mode

3. **Enter Patterns:**
   - Paste the search pattern in the "Search" field
   - Paste the replace pattern in the "Replace" field (or leave empty for deletion)

4. **Configure Scope:**
   - Use "files to include" to target specific file types (e.g., `*.md`)
   - Use "files to exclude" to skip certain directories

5. **Preview and Apply:**
   - Click "Replace All" to apply globally
   - Or use "Replace" to review each match individually

### Best Practices

1. **Test First:**
   - Always test patterns on a sample file first
   - Use version control to track changes
   - Create backups before bulk operations

2. **Order of Operations:**
   - Clean metadata first (most complex pattern)
   - Then remove images and includes (simpler patterns)

3. **Preserve Spacing:**
   - To maintain line spacing when removing content, replace with `\n` instead of empty string

4. **File Selection:**
   - Use glob patterns to target specific directories
   - Example: `docs/**/*.md` for all markdown files in docs folder

| `\n  ` | Two-space indentation | YAML list items or multiline content |
| `\n    ` | Four-space indentation | Nested YAML content |

### Markdown-Specific Patterns

| Pattern | Matches | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `!\[...\]` | Image alt text | Markdown image syntax |
| `(...)` | URL in parentheses | Link/image URL |
| `{%...%}` | Liquid template tags | Template processing |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Lone quantifier brackets" error:**
   - Replace `\s` with `[ ]` for spaces
   - Use simplified patterns when possible

2. **Pattern not matching:**
   - Check for variations in spacing/indentation
   - Verify special characters are properly escaped
   - Test with simpler patterns first

3. **Capturing wrong content:**
   - Use negative lookaheads to stop at boundaries
   - Make quantifiers non-greedy with `?`
   - Test capture groups individually

4. **Performance issues:**
   - Use more specific patterns to reduce backtracking
   - Process files in smaller batches
   - Consider using command-line tools for very large operations
