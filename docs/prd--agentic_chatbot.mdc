# Product Requirements Document: LangGraph Chatbot Development for FiddleJam

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development roadmap for building a sophisticated agentic chatbot application using LangGraph as part of the **FiddleJam hackathon**. The primary objective is to stress test Fiddler's agentic monitoring capabilities by building agentic applications using LangGraph and testing them on the Fiddler platform using the Fiddler LangGraph SDK.

## Project Context: FiddleJam Hackathon

**FiddleJam** is Fiddler's internal hackathon focused on exploring and validating agentic monitoring capabilities. The core mission of this project is to:

- Build agentic applications using LangGraph framework
- Integrate comprehensive Fiddler monitoring from the initial phase
- Stress test Fiddler's agentic monitoring infrastructure
- Validate monitoring capabilities across various agentic workflows
- Demonstrate real-world agentic application monitoring scenarios

**Key Success Metric**: Successful integration and monitoring of agentic workflows within the Fiddler platform, providing valuable insights for Fiddler's agentic monitoring product development.

This project follows an iterative, verification-driven approach, emphasizing small, testable increments with validation at each stage, avoiding large-scale development without proper testing.

## Core Development Philosophy

### Iterative Development Approach

- **Small, Verifiable Units**: Start with the smallest possible functional component
- **Continuous Validation**: Verify functionality at every development stage
- **No Pseudocode**: All code must be tested and working before proceeding
- **Incremental Building**: Each phase builds upon the previous verified foundation

### Technology Constraints

- **Primary Framework**: LangGraph (mandatory where alternatives exist)
- **LangChain Usage**: Prohibited when LangGraph alternatives are available
- **State Management**: Utilize LangGraph state for chatbot functionality
- **Monitoring Integration**: Fiddler LangGraph SDK (mandatory from Phase 1)
- **Initial Interface**: CLI-based (Streamlit integration planned for later phases)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation - Simple Chatbot with Fiddler Monitoring

**Objective**: Create a basic, functional CLI chatbot using LangGraph with integrated Fiddler monitoring

**Deliverables**:

- Basic LangGraph state implementation
- Fiddler LangGraph SDK integration
- CLI interface for user interaction
- Input/output handling with monitoring
- Basic error handling
- Fiddler platform visibility and monitoring dashboard

**Success Criteria**:

- Chatbot conversations are visible in Fiddler platform web UI
- Agentic workflows are properly monitored and tracked
- Basic monitoring metrics are captured and displayed
- Integration with Fiddler monitoring is stable and consistent

**Verification Steps**:

- Manual testing of conversation flow
- Edge case handling (empty inputs, special characters)
- Validation of Fiddler monitoring integration
- Verification of data visibility in Fiddler platform

### Phase 2: RAG Integration

**Objective**: Add Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities

**Deliverables**:

- read info from local_assets/vector_index_feed_*.csv
- RAG-enhanced response generation

**Success Criteria**:

- Chatbot can retrieve relevant context from knowledge base
- Responses are enhanced with retrieved information
- RAG pipeline is stable and consistent
- Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
- shows up in Fiddler platform web UI

### Phase 3: Response Quality Validation

**Objective**: Implement response quality checks using Fiddler guardrails

**Deliverables**:

- Fiddler guardrails integration
- Response faithfulness validation
- Conciseness evaluation
- Quality scoring system
- Automated quality checks

**Success Criteria**:

- Responses are evaluated for faithfulness
- Conciseness metrics are implemented
- Quality scores are generated consistently (Fiddler platform web UI)
- Poor responses are flagged or improved

**Verification Steps**:

- Measure improvement in response quality

### Phase 4: Tool Usage Integration

**Objective**: Add tool calling capabilities to the chatbot

**Deliverables**:

- Tool definition framework
- Tool execution system
- Tool result integration
- Enhanced conversation flow with tool usage
- Tool selection logic

**Success Criteria**:

- Chatbot can identify when tools are needed
- Tools are executed correctly
- Tool results are integrated into responses
- Tool usage enhances conversation quality

**Verification Steps**:

- Test various tool scenarios
- Validate tool selection accuracy
- Measure response improvement with tools
- Error handling for tool failures

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & UI Enhancement

**Objective**: Implement Streamlit interface and advanced capabilities

**Deliverables**:

- Streamlit web interface
- Enhanced user experience
- Advanced conversation features
- Deployment configuration
- Performance optimizations

**Success Criteria**:

- Web interface is intuitive and responsive
- All CLI functionality is preserved
- Advanced features work seamlessly
- Application is deployment-ready

**Verification Steps**:

- UI/UX testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance testing
- User acceptance testing

## Overall Success Criteria

### FiddleJam Hackathon Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Successful stress testing of Fiddler's agentic monitoring capabilities
- **Monitoring Integration**: Fiddler LangGraph SDK integration working from Phase 1
- **Platform Visibility**: All agentic workflows visible and tracked in Fiddler platform
- **Validation**: Comprehensive monitoring of various agentic application scenarios

### Development Quality Standards

- Each phase must be fully functional before proceeding
- All features must be tested and verified
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Code quality standards must be maintained
- Fiddler monitoring integration must be available across all phases

## Risk Mitigation

- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to phase-based development
- **Testing Gaps**: Mandatory verification at each phase
- **Integration Issues**: Continuous integration testing
- **Monitoring Failures**: Early integration of Fiddler monitoring in Phase 1 to identify issues
- **Platform Compatibility**: Regular validation of Fiddler LangGraph SDK compatibility
- **Data Visibility**: Continuous monitoring of data flow to Fiddler platform
