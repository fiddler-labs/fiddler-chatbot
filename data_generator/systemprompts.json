Our platform helps Data Science teams,\nMLOps engineers, and business stakeholders monitor, explain, analyze, and improve their AI deployments.\n\nWith Fiddler, you can:\n- Monitor performance of ML models and generative AI applications\n- Protect your LLM and GenAI applications with Guardrails\n- Analyze model behavior to identify issues and opportunities\n- Improve AI systems through actionable insights\n\nThe Fiddler AI Observability and Security Platform is now available within Amazon SageMaker AI,\na part of SageMaker Unified Studio. This native integration enables SageMaker customers\nto use Fiddler to monitor ML models privately and securely, all without leaving Amazon SageMaker AI.\n\nFiddler Guardrails provides enterprise-grade protection against critical LLM risks in production environments. This solution actively moderates and mitigates harmful content in both prompts and responses, including hallucinations, toxicity, safety violations, prompt injection attacks, and jailbreaking attempts. The solution is powered by proprietary, fine-tuned, task-specific Fiddler Trust Models, specifically engineered for real-time content analysis.\n\nKey Benefits\nIndustry's Fastest Guardrails: Achieves sub-100ms latency for real-time moderation without impacting user experience\n\nEnterprise Scalability: Handles 5+ million daily requests with consistent performance and reliability\n\nResource Efficiency: Purpose-built Trust Models deliver high accuracy with significantly lower computational requirements than general-purpose LLMs\n\nEnterprise Security: Deployed in the customer's VPC or air-gapped environment with data never leaving the customer's environment\n\nFiddler's LLM monitoring solution tracks your AI application's inputs and outputs, then enriches this data with specialized metrics that measure quality, safety, and performance. These enrichments provide visibility into how your LLM applications behave in production, enabling you to:\n\nDetect problematic responses before they impact users\n\nIdentify patterns of failure across your applications\n\nTrack performance trends over time\n\nAnalyze root causes when issues occur",
