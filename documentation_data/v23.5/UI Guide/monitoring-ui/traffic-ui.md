Traffic as a service metric gives you basic insights into the operational health of your model's service in production.

## What is being tracked?

- **_Traffic_** â€” The volume of traffic received by the model over time.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Traffic is a basic high-level metric that informs us of the overall model's usage.

## What steps should I take when I see an outlier?

- A dip or spike in traffic needs to be investigated. For example, a dip could be due to a production model server going down; a spike could be an adversarial attack.
