One way to publish production data to Fiddler is by streaming data asynchronously.

This process is very simple, but it requires that each event is structured as a Python dictionary that maps field names (as they are [onboarded](ref:fdlmodelinfo) with Fiddler) to values.

***

## Example 1: A simple three-input fraud model.

```python
my_event = {
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "Male",
    "salary": 80000.0,
    "predicted_fraud": 0.89,
    "is_fraud": 1
}
```

> ðŸš§ Note
> 
> If you have a pandas DataFrame, you can easily **convert it into a list of event dictionaries** in the above form by using its `to_dict` function.

```python Python
my_events = my_df.to_dict(orient="records")
```

***

Then to upload the event to Fiddler, all you have to do is call the Fiddler client's `publish_event` method.

```python
client.publish_event(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    model_id=MODEL_ID,
    event=my_event,
    event_timestamp=1635862057000
)
```

_After calling the function, please allow 3-5 minutes for events to populate the_ **_Monitor_** _page._

> ðŸ“˜ Info
> 
> The `event_timestamp` field should contain the **Unix timestamp in milliseconds** for the time the event occurred. This timestamp will be used to plot the event on time series charts for monitoring.
> 
> If you do not specify an event timestamp, the current time will be used.

## Example 2: Bank churn event

In order to send traffic to Fiddler, use the [`publish_event`](ref:clientpublish_event) API from the Fiddler SDK. Here is a sample of the API call:

```python Publish Event
import fiddler as fdl
	fiddler_api = fdl.FiddlerApi(url=url, org_id=org_id, auth_token=token)
	# Publish an event
	fiddler_api.publish_event(
		project_id='bank_churn',
		model_id='bank_churn',
		event={
			"CreditScore": 650,      # data type: int
			"Geography": "France",   # data type: category
			"Gender": "Female",
			"Age": 45,
			"Tenure": 2,
			"Balance": 10000.0,      # data type: float
			"NumOfProducts": 1,
			"HasCrCard": "Yes",
			"isActiveMember": "Yes",
			"EstimatedSalary": 120000,
			"probability_churned": 0.105,
      "churn": 1
		},
		event_id=â€™some_unique_idâ€™, #optional
		update_event=False, #optional
		event_timestamp=1511253040519 #optional
	)
```

The `publish_event` API can be called in real-time right after your model inference. 

> ðŸ“˜ Info
> 
> You can also publish events as part of a batch call after the fact using the `publish_events_batch` API (click [here](ref:clientpublish_events_batch) for more information). In this case, you will need to send Fiddler the original event timestamps as to accurately populate the time series charts.

Following is a description of all the parameters for `publish_event`:

- `project_id`: Project ID for the project this event belongs to.

- `model_id`: Model ID for the model this event belongs to.

- `event`: The actual event as an array. The event can contain:

  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - Target
  - Decisions (categorical only)
  - Metadata

- `event_id`: A user-generated unique event ID that Fiddler can use to join inputs/outputs to targets/decisions/metadata sent later as an update.

- `update_event`: A flag indicating if the event is a new event (insertion) or an update to an existing event. When updating an existing event, it's required that the user sends an `event_id`.

- `event_timestamp`: The timestamp at which the event (or update) occurred, represented as a UTC timestamp in milliseconds. When updating an existing event, use the time of the update, i.e., the time the target/decision were generated and not when the model predictions were made.
