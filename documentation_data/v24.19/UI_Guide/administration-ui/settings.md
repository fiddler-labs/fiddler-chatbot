### Webhooks

Webhooks enable you to link Fiddler to your own notification and communication services and have them receive Fiddler alerts as they are triggered. We support Slack webhook integration directly as well as a custom webhook that can be used with any webhook-consuming platform.\
You can manage these webhooks in the 'Webhook Integration' tab.

**Configure a New Slack Webhook**

From the "Webhook Integrations" tab, use the + icon on the "Webhook Integration" tab to configure a new webhook.

![Create Webhook Service modal dialog](../../.gitbook/assets/a0b33c4-Screenshot\_2023-10-10\_at\_12.46.31\_PM.png)

Follow these steps:

1. Enter a unique webhook name in the **Service Name** textbox
2. Select Slack in the **Provider** dropdown
3. Enter the Slack webhook URL provided by your Slack administrator which will appear similar to this example: [https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxxxxxxx](https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxxxxxxx)
4. Test the webhook service using the **Test** button
5. Click the **Create** button once the test is successful

Slack documentation on creating webhooks can be reviewed [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

**Configure a New Custom Webhook**

To configure a webhook for any other platform, follow the same steps listed for the Slack webhook, but instead select **Other** for Provider type and enter the webhook URL provided by the platform's administrator.

1. Enter a unique webhook name in the **Service Name** textbox
2. Select Other in the **Provider** dropdown
3. Enter the webhook URL provided by your platform administrator
4. Test the webhook service using the **Test** button
5. Click the **Create** button once the test is successful

> ðŸš§ Custom Webhooks
>
> Note that many platforms will require some amount of configuration in order to properly receive and act on the notifications sent by third party software like Fiddler.

#### Edit or Delete a Webhook

![Webhooks list on the Webhook Integration tab with Delete Webhook and Edit Webhook actions](../../.gitbook/assets/f7be111-Screenshot\_2023-10-09\_at\_4.58.02\_PM.png)

You can manage your webhook from the **Webhook Integrations** tab.

1. Select the webhook that you want to edit/delete using the "..." icon towards the right of a webhook integration row.
2. Select the **Delete Webhook** option to delete the webhook

> ðŸš§ Deleting a Webhook
>
> You will not be able to delete a webhook that is already linked to alerts. To delete the webhook, you will need to modify the alert and then delete the webhook

3. Select the **Edit Webhook** option to edit the webhook
4. Click the **Test** button to test your changes
5. Click the **Save** button once the test is successful
