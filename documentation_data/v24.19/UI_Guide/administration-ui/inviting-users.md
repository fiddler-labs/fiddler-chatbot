# Adding Users

Fiddler supports both Single Sign-On (SSO) and built-in user authentication called _Email Authentication_. _Email Authentication_ is managed entirely within the Fiddler application by users having the Org Admin [role](../../product-guide/administration-platform.md#understanding-roles). Organizations using solely SSO authentication or a mix of SSO and Email Authentication will still need to invite SSO users to Fiddler following the **Invite a User to Fiddler** process described below.

### Invite a User to Fiddler

> ðŸš§ To invite a user to Fiddler, you will need to have the Org Admin [role](../../product-guide/administration-platform.md#understanding-roles). If you do not have access to this role, please contact your Fiddler Org Admin.

To invite a user follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page
2. Click on the **Access** tab
3. Click on the **Invitations** sub-tab
4. Click on the plus icon on the right

Clicking on the invite button opens a modal dialog:

Once the invitation has been sent, the user should receive a sign-up link at the email provided.

### Getting an invitation link

In the case where the email address is not associated with a user inbox, you can get the invite link by clicking **Copy invite link** after the invitation has been created.
