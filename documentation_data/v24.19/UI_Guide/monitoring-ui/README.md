# Monitoring

Fiddler Monitoring helps you identify issues with the performance of your ML models after deployment. Fiddler Monitoring has several Metric Types which can be monitored and alerted on:

1. **Traffic**
2. **Data Drift**
3. **Data Integrity**
4. **Performance**
5. **Statistic**
6. **Custom Metric**

The sections contained in this UI Guide provide an overview of using Fiddler's UI for model monitoring.
