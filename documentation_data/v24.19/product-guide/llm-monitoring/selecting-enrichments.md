# Selecting Enrichments

Fiddler offers enrichments out of the box to monitor different aspects of LLM applications. Use the below table to select the right enrichment for your specific use case.

This table provides high level information on the metric, the enrichment to use to measure the metric, if the metric uses LLMs, and if so, what LLM it uses.

If you have a use case not covered by the below enrichments out of the box, please contact your administrator.
