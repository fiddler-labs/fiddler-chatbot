# Monitoring

Fiddler Monitoring helps you identify issues with the performance of your ML and LLM models after deployment. Fiddler Monitoring has five out-of-the-box Metric Types in addition to Custom Metrics which can be monitored and alerted on:

1. **Data Drift**
2. **Performance**
3. **Data Integrity**
4. **Traffic**
5. **Statistic**
6. **Custom Metrics**

These metrics can be visualized using Charts and Dashboards and alerted on for swift root cause analysis.
