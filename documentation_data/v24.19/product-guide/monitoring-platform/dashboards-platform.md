# Dashboards

### Overview

With Fiddler, you can create comprehensive dashboards that bring together all of your monitoring data in one place. This includes monitoring charts for data drift, traffic, data integrity, and performance metrics. Adding monitoring charts to your dashboards lets you create a detailed view of your model's performance. These dashboards can inform your team, management, or stakeholders, and help make data-driven decisions that improve your AI performance. View a list of the [**available metrics for monitoring charts here**](monitoring-charts-platform.md#supported-metric-types).
