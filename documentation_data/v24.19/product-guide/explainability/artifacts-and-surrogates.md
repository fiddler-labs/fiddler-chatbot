# Model: Artifacts, Package, Surrogate

### Model Artifacts and Model Package

A model in Fiddler is a placeholder that may not need the **model artifacts** for monitoring purposes. However, for explainability, model artifacts are needed.

_Required_ model artifacts include:

* The \*\*[model file](artifacts-and-surrogates.md#model-file) \*\*(e.g. `*.pkl`)
* [`package.py`](artifacts-and-surrogates.md#packagepy-wrapper-script): A wrapper script containing all of the code needed to standardize the execution of the model.

A collection of model artifacts in a directory is referred to as a **model package**. To start, **place your model artifacts in a new directory**. This directory will be the model package you will upload to Fiddler to add or update model artifacts.

While the model file and package.py are required artifacts in a model package, you can also _optionally_ add other artifacts such as any serialized [preprocessing objects](artifacts-and-surrogates.md#preprocessing-objects) needed to transform data before running predictions or after.

In the following, we discuss the various model artifacts.

#### Model File

A model file is a **serialized representation of your model** as a Python object.

Model files can be stored in a variety of formats. Some include

* Pickle (`.pkl`)
* Protocol buffer (`.pb`)
* Hierarchical Data Format/HDF5 (`.h5`)

#### package.py wrapper script

Fiddlerâ€™s artifact upload process is **framework-agnostic**. Because of this, a **wrapper script** is needed to let Fiddler know how to interact with your particular model and framework.

The wrapper script should be named `package.py`, and it should be **placed in the same directory as your model artifact**. Below is an example of what `package.py` should look like.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

PACKAGE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent

class MyModel:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Here we can load in the model and any other necessary
            serialized objects from the PACKAGE_PATH.
        """

    def predict(self, input_df):
        """
        The predict() function should return a DataFrame of predictions
            whose columns correspond to the outputs of your model.
        """

def get_model():
    return MyModel()
```

The only hard requirements for `package.py` are

* The script must be named `package.py`
* The script must implement a function called `get_model`, which returns a model object
* This model object must implement a function called `predict`, which takes in a pandas DataFrame of model inputs and returns a pandas DataFrame of model predictions

#### Preprocessing objects

Another component of your model package could be any **serialized preprocessing objects** that are used to transform the data before or after making predictions.

You can place these in the model package directory as well.

> ðŸ“˜ Info
>
> For example, in the case that we have a **categorical feature**, we may need to **encode** it as one or more numeric columns before calling the modelâ€™s prediction function. In that case, we may have a serialized transform object called `encoder.pkl`. This should also be included in the model package directory.

#### requirements.txt file

> ðŸ“˜ Info
>
> This is only used starting at 23.1 version with Model Deployment enabled.

Each base image (see [flexible model deployment](flexible-model-deployment/) for more information on base images) comes with a few pre-installed libraries and these can be overridden by specifying `requirements.txt` file inside your model artifact directory where `package.py` is defined.

Add the dependencies to requirements.txt file like this:

```python
scikit-learn==1.0.2  
numpy==1.23.0  
pandas==1.5.0
```

### Surrogate Model

A surrogate model is an approximation of your model intended to make qualitative explainability calculations possible for scenarios where model ingestion is impossible or explainability is an occasional nice-to-have, but not a primary component of a model monitoring workflow.

Fiddler creates a surrogate when you call [`add_surrogate`](../../Python\_Client\_3-x/api-methods-30.md#add\_surrogate). This requires that you've already added a model using [model.create](../../Python\_Client\_3-x/api-methods-30.md#create-3).

> ðŸš§ Surrogates can currently only be created for models with tabular input types.

Fiddler produces a surrogate by training a gradient-boosted decision tree (LightGBM) to the ground-truth labels provided and with a general, predefined set of settings.

### Custom dependencies

If your model artifact requires specific packages to run, Fiddler can support this with the Flexible Model Deployment feature. See [here](flexible-model-deployment/) for details on how to configure your model with the correct requirements.
