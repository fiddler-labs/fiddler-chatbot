# Compatibility Matrix

This table summarizes the compatibility between the Fiddler Python client and the Fiddler application. You can find:

* **Corresponding Fiddler Platform(s)**: Exactly the same features / API objects in both python client and the Fiddler Platform version
* **Lower Fiddler Platform**: Python client has features or API objects that may not be present in the Fiddler Platform, either due to that python client has additional new methods, or that the server has removed old APIs. However, everything they have in common (i.e., most APIs) will work.
* **Higher Fiddler Platform**: The Fiddler Platform has features the python client can't use, either due to the server has additional new APIs, or that python client has removed old API. However, everything they share in common (i.e., most APIs) will work.
