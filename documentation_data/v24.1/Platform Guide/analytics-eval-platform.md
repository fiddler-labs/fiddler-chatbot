## Analytics

Fiddler’s industry-first model analytics tool, called Slice and Explain, allows you to perform an exploratory or targeted analysis of model behavior.

1. **_Slice_** — Identify a selection, or slice, of data. Or, you can start with the entire dataset for global analysis.
2. **_Explain_** — Analyze model behavior on that slice using Fiddler’s visual explanations and other data insights.

Slice and Explain is designed to help data scientists, model validators, and analysts drill down into a model and dataset to see global, local, or instance-level explanations for the model’s predictions.

Slice and Explain can help you answer questions like:

- What are the key drivers of my model output in a subsection of the data?
- How are the model inputs correlated to other inputs and to the output?
- Where is my model underperforming?
- How is my model performing across the classes in a protected group?

Access Slice and Explain from the Analyze tab for your model. Slice and Explain currently support all tabular models.

## Evaluation

Model performance evaluation is one of the key tasks in the ML model lifecycle. A model's performance indicates how successful the model is at making useful predictions on data.
