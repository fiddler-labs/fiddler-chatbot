Fiddler provides a monitoring experience that doesn't require a model artifact or surrogate model. Users can easily ingest their data and get started with the Fiddler monitoring functionality. 

Users can get started by:

1. Uploading a dataset
2. Adding a Model
3. Pulishing their production data

If at later point in time, users would like to enable the full set of Fiddler's explainability features they can add  a Fiddler generated surrogate model or upload their own model artifact to their existing model.
