## Invite a user to Fiddler

> ðŸš§ To invite a user to Fiddler, you will need [Administrator permissions](doc:authorization-and-access-control). If you do not have access to an Administrator account, please contact your server administrator.

Inviting a user is easy. From anywhere on the Fiddler UI, just follow these four steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page.
2. Click on the **Access** tab.
3. Click on the **Invitations** section.
4. Click on the plus icon on the right.

When you click on the plus icon, an invite popup screen will appear as follows:

Once the invitation has been sent, the user should receive a signup link at the email provided.

## Getting an invitation link

In the case where the email address is not associated with an inbox, you can get the invite link by clicking **Copy invite link** after the invitation has been created.

## What if I'm using SSO?

Whether you are using normal sign-on or single sign-on, **the process for inviting users is the same**.

If using SSO, a user should still sign up using their invitation link. Once they have created their account, their SSO login will be enabled.
