Projects are **used to organize your models and datasets**. Each project can represent a machine learning task (e.g. predicting house prices, assessing creditworthiness, or detecting fraud).

A project **can contain one or more models** (e.g. lin_reg_house_predict, random_forest_house_predict).

For more information on projects, click [here](doc:project-structure).
