Fiddler offers an integration with Datadog which allows Fiddler and Datadog customers to bring their AI Observability metrics from Fiddler into their centralized Datadog dashboards.  Additionally, a Fiddler license can now be procured through the [Datadog Marketplace](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/tag/datadog-marketplace/). This [integration](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-machine-learning-models-fiddler/) enables you to centralize your monitoring of ML models and the applications that utilize them within one unified platform.
