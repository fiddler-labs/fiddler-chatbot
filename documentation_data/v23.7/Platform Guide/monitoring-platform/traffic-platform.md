## What is being tracked?

- **_Traffic_** — The volume of traffic received by the model over time.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Traffic is a basic high-level metric that informs us of the overall system's health.

## What steps should I take when I see an outlier?

- A dip or spike in traffic needs to be investigated. For example, a dip could be due to a production model server going down; a spike could be an adversarial attack.
