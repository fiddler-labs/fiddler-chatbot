Datasets (or baseline datasets) are used for making comparisons with production data.

A baseline dataset should be sampled from your model's training set, so it can serve as a representation of what the model expects to see in production.

For more information, see [Uploading a Baseline Dataset](doc:uploading-a-baseline-dataset).

For guidance on how to design a baseline dataset, see [Designing a Baseline Dataset](doc:designing-a-baseline-dataset).
