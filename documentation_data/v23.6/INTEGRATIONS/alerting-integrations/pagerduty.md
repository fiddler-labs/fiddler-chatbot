Fiddler offers powerful alerting tools for monitoring models. By integrating with  
PagerDuty services, you gain the ability to trigger PagerDuty events within your monitoring  
workflow.

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> If your organization has already integrated with PagerDuty, then you may skip to the [Setup: In Fiddler](#setup-in-fiddler) section to learn more about setting up PagerDuty within Fiddler.

## Setup: In PagerDuty
