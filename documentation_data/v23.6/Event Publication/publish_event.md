Event publication is the process of sending your model's prediction logs, or events, to the Fiddler platform.  Using the [Fiddler Client](ref:about-the-fiddler-client), events can be published in batch or streaming mode.  Using these events, Fiddler will calculate metrics around feature drift, prediction drift, and model performance.  These events are also stored in Fiddler to allow for ad hoc segment analysis.  Please read the sections that follow to learn more about how to use the Fiddler Client for event publication.
