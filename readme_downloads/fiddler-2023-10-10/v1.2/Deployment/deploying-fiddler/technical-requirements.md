The requirements and installation steps for deploying Fiddlerâ€™s scalable centralized platform architecture using different cloud services provider are described below.

## Fiddler Platform
Fiddler System requirements for scalable Centralized platform Architecture

- Deployment: Managed k8s 
- Compute: 8 cores, 32GB memory per instance (Recommended m5.2xlarge or equivalent)
- Minimum 2 instances (for product services)
- Database: DB storage (Assuming total dataset size < 100GB)
- Persistent volume: 3 blocks (rabbitmq - 32GB, postgres - 256GB) 
- Shared Storage: S3 or compatible Object Store - min 128GB (depends on data and type of models) 
- Container Registry: Quay or ECR
- Ingress Controller: Envoy-proxy/ingress-nginx
- DNS/IP address: Need to set up an IP address and direct to m/c where Fiddler is running
- Logs: Accessibility to application logs


## Software Packages

- Python3 (RHEL) 
- NodeJS
- ReactJS
