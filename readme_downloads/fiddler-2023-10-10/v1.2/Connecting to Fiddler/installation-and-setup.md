Fiddler offers a **Python SDK client** that allows you to connect to Fiddler directly from a Jupyter notebook or automated pipeline.

***

The client is available for download from PyPI via `pip`:

```
pip install fiddler-client
```

<br>

Once you've installed the client, you can import the `fiddler` package into any Python script:

```python
import fiddler as fdl
```
