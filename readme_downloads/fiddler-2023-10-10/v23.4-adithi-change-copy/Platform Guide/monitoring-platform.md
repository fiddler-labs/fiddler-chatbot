Fiddler Monitoring helps you identify issues with the performance of your ML models after deployment. Fiddler Monitoring has five main features:

1. **Data Drift**
2. **Performance**
3. **Data Integrity**
4. **Service Metrics**
5. **Alerts**

## Integrate with Fiddler Monitoring

Integrating Fiddler monitoring is a four-step process:

1. **Upload dataset**

   Fiddler needs a dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring. A dataset can be uploaded to Fiddler using our UI and Python package. For more information, see:

   - [client.upload_dataset()](ref:clientupload_dataset) 

2. **Onboard model**

   Fiddler needs some specifications about your model in order to help you troubleshoot production issues. Fiddler supports a wide variety of model formats. For more information, see:

   - [client.add_model()](ref:clientadd_model) 

3. **Configure monitoring for this model**

   You will need to configure bins and alerts for your model. These will be discussed in detail below.

4. **Send traffic from your live deployed model to Fiddler**

   Use the Fiddler SDK to send us traffic from your live deployed model.

## Publish events to Fiddler

In order to send traffic to Fiddler, use the [`publish_event`](ref:clientpublish_event) API from the Fiddler SDK.

The `publish_event` API can be called in real-time right after your model inference. 

An event can contain the following:

- Inputs
- Outputs
- Target
- Decisions (categorical only)
- Metadata

These aspects of an event can be monitored on the platform.

> ðŸ“˜ Info
> 
> You can also publish events as part of a batch call after the fact using the `publish_events_batch` API (click [here](ref:clientpublish_events_batch) for more information). In this case, you will need to send Fiddler the original event timestamps as to accurately populate the time series charts.

## Updating events

Fiddler supports [partial updates of events](doc:updating-events) for your **target** column. This can be useful when you donâ€™t have access to the ground truth for your model at the time the model's prediction is made. Other columns can only be sent at insertion time (with `update_event=False`).
