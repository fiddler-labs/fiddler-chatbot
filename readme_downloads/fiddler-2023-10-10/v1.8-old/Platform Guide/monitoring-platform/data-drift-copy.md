Model performance can be poor if models trained on a specific dataset encounter different data in production. This is called data drift. 

## What is being tracked?

Fiddler supports the following:

- **_Drift Metrics_**
  - **Jensenâ€“Shannon distance (JSD)**
    - A distance metric calculated between the distribution of a field in the baseline dataset and that same distribution for the time period of interest.
    - For more information on JSD, click [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon.html).
  - **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
    - A drift metric based on the multinomial classification of a variable into bins or categories. The differences in each bin between the baseline and the time period of interest are then utilized to calculate it as follows:

> ðŸš§ Note
> 
> There is a possibility that PSI can shoot to infinity. To avoid this, PSI calculation in Fiddler is done such that each bin count is incremented with a base_count=1. Thus, there might be a slight difference in the PSI values obtained from manual calculations.

- **_Average Values_** â€“ The mean of a field (feature or prediction) over time. This can be thought of as an intuitive drift score.
- **_Drift Analytics_** â€“ You can drill down into the features responsible for the prediction drift using the table at the bottom.
  - **_Feature Impact_**: The contribution of a feature to the modelâ€™s predictions, averaged over the baseline dataset. The contribution is calculated using random ablation feature impact.
  - **_Feature Drift_**: Drift of the feature, calculated using the drift metric of choice.
  - **_Prediction Drift Impact_**: A heuristic calculated using the product of the feature impact and the feature drift. The higher the score, the more this feature is likely to have contributed to the prediction drift.

## Why is it being tracked?

- Data drift is a great proxy metric for **performance decline**, especially if there is delay in getting labels for production events. (e.g. In a credit lending use case, an actual default may happen after months or years.)
- Monitoring data drift also helps you stay informed about **distributional shifts in the data for features of interest**, which could have business implications even if there is no decline in model performance. You can use different [baselines](doc:fiddler-baselines) to check model performance on various datasets for seasonality.
