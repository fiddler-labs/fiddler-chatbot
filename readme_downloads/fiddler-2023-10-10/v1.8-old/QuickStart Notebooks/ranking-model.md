This notebook will show you how Fiddler enables monitoring and explainability for a Ranking model. This notebook uses a dataset from Expedia that includes shopping and purchase data with information on price competitiveness. The data are organized around a set of “search result impressions”, or the ordered list of hotels that the user sees after they search for a hotel on the Expedia website.
