A model is a **representation of your machine learning model**. Each model must have an associated dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring, explainability, and fairness capabilities.

You **do not need to upload your model artifact in order to register your model**, but doing so will significantly improve the quality of explanations generated by Fiddler.
