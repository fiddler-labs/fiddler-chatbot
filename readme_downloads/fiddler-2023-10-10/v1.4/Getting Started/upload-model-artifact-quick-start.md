This guide will walk you through the basic  steps required to onboard a model in Fiddler with its model artifact.  When Fiddler is provided with the actual model artifact, it can produce high-fidelity explanations. In contrast, models within Fiddler that use a surrogate model or no model artifact at all provide approximative explainability or no explainability at all.
