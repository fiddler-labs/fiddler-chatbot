This guide will walk you through the basic onboarding steps required to use Fiddler for model production monitoring, **using sample data provided by Fiddler**.  This guide does not upload a model artifact or create a surrogate model, both of which are supported by Fiddler.  As a result, this guide won't allow you to explore explainability within the platform.
