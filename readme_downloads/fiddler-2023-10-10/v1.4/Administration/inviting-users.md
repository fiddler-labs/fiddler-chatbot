Inviting a user is easy. From anywhere on the Fiddler UI, just follow these four steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page.
2. Click on the **Access** tab.
3. Click on the **Invitations** section.
4. Click on the plus icon on the right.

Once the invitation has been sent, the user should receive a signup link at the email provided.

}
[/block]
In the case where the email address is not associated with an inbox, you can get the invite link by clicking **Copy invite link** after the invitation has been created.

Whether you are using normal sign-on or single sign-on, **the process for inviting users is the same**.

If using SSO, a user should still sign up using their invitation link. Once they have created their account, their SSO login will be enabled.
