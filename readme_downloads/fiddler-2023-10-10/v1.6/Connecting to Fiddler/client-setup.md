The Client object is used to communicate with Fiddler.  In order to use the client, you'll need to provide authentication details as shown below.

For more information, see [Authorizing the Client](doc:authorizing-the-client).

> To maximize compatibility, **please ensure that your client version matches the server version for your Fiddler instance.**
> 
> When you connect to Fiddler using the code on the right, you'll receive a notification if there is a version mismatch between the client and server.

```python Connect the Client
import fiddler as fdl

URL = 'https://app.fiddler.ai'
ORG_ID = 'my_org'
AUTH_TOKEN = 'p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58'

client = fdl.FiddlerApi(
    url=URL,
    org_id=ORG_ID,
    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN
)
```
```python Connect the Client with self-signed certs
import fiddler as fdl

URL = 'https://app.fiddler.ai'
ORG_ID = 'my_org'
AUTH_TOKEN = 'p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58'

client = fdl.FiddlerApi(
    url=URL,
    org_id=ORG_ID,
    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN,

```python Defining Proxy URLs
proxies = {
    'http' : 'http://proxy.example.com:1234',
    'https': 'https://proxy.example.com:5678'
}
```



If you want to authenticate with Fiddler without passing this information directly into the function call, you can store it in a file named_ fiddler.ini_, which should be stored in the same directory as your notebook or script.

```python Writing fiddler.ini
%%writefile fiddler.ini

[FIDDLER]
url = https://app.fiddler.ai
org_id = my_org
auth_token = p9uqlkKz1zAA3KAU8kiB6zJkXiQoqFgkUgEa1sv4u58
```



```python Connecting the Client with a fiddler.ini file
client = fdl.FiddlerApi()
```
