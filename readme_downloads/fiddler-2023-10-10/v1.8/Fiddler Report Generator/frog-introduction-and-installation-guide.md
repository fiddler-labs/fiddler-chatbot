Fiddler Report Generator (FRoG) is a stand-alone python package that enables Fiddler users to generate and save reports for the projects and models that are deployed on Fiddler. Reports generated by FRoG are especially useful in scenarios where static and cyclic reports are needed (e.g. model governance and MRM reports) for the models deployed on Fiddler. Fiddler report generator adopts a fully modular design so that users can easily customize a report by choosing and modifying the building blocks of a report.
