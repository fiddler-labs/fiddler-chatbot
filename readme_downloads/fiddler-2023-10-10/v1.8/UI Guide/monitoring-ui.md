Fiddler Monitoring helps you identify issues with the performance of your ML models after deployment. Fiddler Monitoring has five main features:

1. **Data Drift**
2. **Performance**
3. **Data Integrity**
4. **Service Metrics**
5. **Alerts**

## Integrate with Fiddler Monitoring

Integrating Fiddler monitoring is a four-step process:

1. **Upload dataset**

   Fiddler needs a dataset to be used as a baseline for monitoring. A dataset can be uploaded to Fiddler using our UI and Python package. For more information, see:

   - [client.upload_dataset()](ref:clientupload_dataset) 

2. **Onboard model**

   Fiddler needs some specifications about your model in order to help you troubleshoot production issues. Fiddler supports a wide variety of model formats. For more information, see:

   - [client.add_model()](ref:clientadd_model)

3. **Configure monitoring for this model**

   You will need to configure bins and alerts for your model. These will be discussed in details below.

4. **Send traffic from your live deployed model to Fiddler**

   Use the Fiddler SDK to send us traffic from your live deployed model.

## Publish events to Fiddler

In order to send traffic to Fiddler, use the [`publish_event`](https://api.fiddler.ai/#client-publish_event) API from the Fiddler SDK. Here is a sample of the API call:

```python Publish Event
import fiddler as fdl
	fiddler_api = fdl.FiddlerApi(url=url, org_id=org_id, auth_token=token)
	# Publish an event
	fiddler_api.publish_event(
		project_id='bank_churn',
		model_id='bank_churn',
		event={
			"CreditScore": 650,      # data type: int
			"Geography": "France",   # data type: category
			"Gender": "Female",
			"Age": 45,
			"Tenure": 2,
			"Balance": 10000.0,      # data type: float
			"NumOfProducts": 1,
			"HasCrCard": "Yes",
			"isActiveMember": "Yes",
			"EstimatedSalary": 120000,
			"probability_churned": 0.105,
      "churn": 1
		},
		event_id=â€™some_unique_idâ€™, #optional
		update_event=False, #optional
		event_timestamp=1511253040519 #optional
	)
```

The `publish_event` API can be called in real-time right after your model inference. 

> ðŸ“˜ Info
> 
> You can also publish events as part of a batch call after the fact using the `publish_events_batch` API (click [here](https://api.fiddler.ai/#client-publish_events_batch) for more information). In this case, you will need to send Fiddler the original event timestamps as to accurately populate the time series charts.

Following is a description of all the parameters for `publish_event`:

- `project_id`: Project ID for the project this event belongs to.

- `model_id`: Model ID for the model this event belongs to.

- `event`: The actual event as an array. The event can contain:

  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - Target
  - Decisions (categorical only)
  - Metadata

- `event_id`: A user-generated unique event ID that Fiddler can use to join inputs/outputs to targets/decisions/metadata sent later as an update.

- `update_event`: A flag indicating if the event is a new event (insertion) or an update to an existing event. When updating an existing event, it's required that the user sends an `event_id`.

- `event_timestamp`: The timestamp at which the event (or update) occurred, represented as a UTC timestamp in milliseconds. When updating an existing event, use the time of the update, i.e., the time the target/decision were generated and not when the model predictions were made.

## Updating events

Fiddler supports partial updates of events for your **target** column. This can be useful when you donâ€™t have access to the ground truth for your model at the time the model's prediction is made. Other columns can only be sent at insertion time (with `update_event=False`).

Set `update_event=True` to indicate that you are updating an existing event. You only need to provide the decision, metadata, and/or target fields that you want to changeâ€”any fields you leave out will remain as they were before the update.

**Example**

Hereâ€™s an example of using the publish event API to update an existing event:

```python Update Existing Event
import fiddler as fdl

fiddler_api = fdl.FiddlerApi(
	url=url,
	org_id=org_id,
	auth_token=token
)

fiddler_api.publish_event(
	project_id='bank_churn',
	model_id='bank_churn',
	event = {
		'churn': 0,    # data type: category
	},
	event_id=â€™some_unique_idâ€™,
	update_event=True
)
```

The above `publish_event` call will tell Fiddler to update the target (`'churn': 0`) of an existing event  (`event_id='some_unique_id'`).

Once youâ€™ve used the SDK to send Fiddler your live event data, that data will show up under the **Monitor** tab in the Fiddler UI:
