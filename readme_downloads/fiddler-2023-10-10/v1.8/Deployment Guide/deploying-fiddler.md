## Deployment Overview

Fiddler runs on most mainstream flavors and configurations of Kubernetes, including OpenShift, Rancher, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service, Azure Managed Kubernetes Service (AKS), GCP Google Kubernetes Engine, and more.

- **Our premises**—Fiddler is offered as a fully managed service, deployed within an isolated network and dedicated hardware in the cloud.

- **Your premises**—Deploy Fiddler into a Kubernetes cluster running in your own cloud account or data center. Please refer to the [On-prem Technical Requirements](doc:technical-requirements#system-requirements) section for more details.
