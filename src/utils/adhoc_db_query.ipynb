       "  'response': \"Onboarding a model to Fiddler''s system can be accomplished either through the Python client or using the UI-based Model Editor. Below, I''ll outline the steps for both methods to give you a comprehensive understanding of the process.\\n\\n### Using the Python Client\\n\\n1. **Review the Model Schema**: Before onboarding the model, ensure that the model''s schema is correctly set up and adheres to the necessary guidelines. This involves specifying the inputs and outputs of the model, along with their data types.\\n\\n2. **Onboard the Model**: Once the schema is confirmed to be correct, you can onboard the model using the Python client. The following code snippet demonstrates how to create the model in the system:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   model.create()\\n   ```\\n\\nThis method requires you to have the Fiddler Python client installed and configured on your machine.\\n\\n### Using the UI-based Model Editor\\n\\nThe UI-based Model Editor provides a more interactive approach to model onboarding, especially useful if you prefer a graphical interface over coding:\\n\\n1. **Access Your Project**:\\n   - Sign in to Fiddler and navigate to the Projects tab.\\n   - Select an existing project or create a new one.\\n\\n2. **Add a Model**:\\n   - Click on ''Add Model'' in the top-right corner.\\n   - Choose the model task type (e.g., Regression, Binary Classification).\\n\\n3. **Upload and Analyze Your Dataset**:\\n   - Upload your dataset in CSV format.\\n   - Review the automatically inferred schema.\\n   - Address any flagged columns that may need additional attention.\\n\\n4. **Choose Your Onboarding Approach**:\\n   - For immediate publication: Enter a model name and select ''Create Model''.\\n   - For draft mode: Choose ''Save as Draft'' to make further edits before finalizing.\\n\\n5. **Work with Your Draft (Draft Mode)**:\\n   - Access your draft from the ''Draft Models'' tab.\\n   - Make necessary edits to the schema details.\\n   - Publish sample data to validate your configuration.\\n   - Once satisfied, publish the finalized model.\\n\\nThe UI-based method is particularly beneficial for those who are less familiar with programming or prefer a more visual setup process. It also allows for easy error checking and schema validation through the interface.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions and best practices on editing the model schema, you can refer to the Model Schema Editing Guide linked within the Model Editor documentation.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBoth methods provide robust ways to onboard models to Fiddler''s system, catering to different preferences and needs. Whether you choose the Python client for a more programmatic approach or the UI-based Model Editor for a graphical interface, Fiddler supports a seamless integration of your models into its platform.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- [Model Onboarding using Python Client](https://docs.fiddler.ai/technical-reference/python-client-guides/model-onboarding)\\n- [Model Onboarding using UI-based Model Editor](https://docs.fiddler.ai/product-guide/model-ui/model-editor)\",\n",

       "  'response': 'Fiddler AI\\'\\'s platform, as described in the provided context, is designed to integrate seamlessly with cloud environments, which suggests that it is a cloud-native service. Cloud-native services are built to leverage the scalability, flexibility, and resilience offered by cloud computing platforms. While the specific term \"cloud-native\" is not directly used in the context, several aspects of Fiddler\\'\\'s service align with cloud-native principles:\\n\\n1. **Scalability and Performance**: Fiddler\\'\\'s platform, particularly the Fiddler Trust Service, is designed for high scalability and low latency operations. It mentions the ability to score and monitor LLM applications at scale with response times of less than 100 milliseconds. This indicates an underlying architecture that can handle rapid scaling and high-performance demands typical of cloud-native services.\\n\\n2. **Real-Time Observability**: The platform provides real-time observability into LLMs, which is a key feature of cloud-native applications. This allows for immediate insights and quick identification of issues, enhancing the ability to dynamically manage and optimize applications in a cloud environment.\\n\\n3. **Integration with Cloud Platforms**: Fiddler is noted as an AWS APN partner and is available on the AWS Marketplace. This partnership with a major cloud provider supports the notion that Fiddler is designed to operate effectively in cloud environments, utilizing cloud-specific resources and services.\\n\\n4. **Security and Compliance**: The AI-assisted vulnerability guidance and real-time recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities suggest a system designed to operate securely in the dynamic and distributed nature of cloud environments.\\n\\n5. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**: The platform\\'\\'s capability to monitor ML deployments in both pre-production and production environments, along with providing continuous feedback loops, aligns with the cloud-native approach of continuous improvement and adaptation.\\n\\nBased on these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that Fiddler operates as a cloud-native service, designed to fully exploit the advantages of cloud computing technologies to enhance the performance, scalability, and reliability of its AI observability and monitoring solutions.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n- No specific URLs provided in the context.',\n",
