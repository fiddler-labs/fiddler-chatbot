Lastly, before you can start publishing LLM conversations into Fiddler for observability, you need to onboard a “model” that represents the inputs, outputs and metadata used by your LLM application. Let’s first create a model_info object which contains the schema for your application.Fiddler will create the embeddings for our unstructured inputs, like query, response and the source documents passed to our Bedrock FM retrieved via RAG. Fiddler offers a variety of “enrichments” that can flag your LLM-applications for potential safety issues like hallucinations, toxicity, and PII leakage. Additionally, you can pass any other metadata to Fiddler like end user feedback (likes/dislikes), FM costs, FM latencies, and source documents from the RAG-retrieval.You’ll note in the model_info object below, we’re defining the primary features as the query and the response, as well as a list of metadata we will be tracking too — some passed to Fiddler like docs, feedback, cost and latency and some calculated by Fiddler like toxicity and PII leakage. Then, you can onboard the LLM application “model” using your new model_info object. After this onboarding, you should see the schema of your LLM application in Fiddler like so: Using the simple-to-deploy serverless architecture of AWS Lambda, you can quickly build the mechanism required to move the logging from your Bedrock FMs from the S3 bucket (setup in step 1 above), into your newly provisioned Fiddler trial environment. This Lambda function will be responsible for opening any new JSON event log files in your model’s S3 bucket, parsing and formatting the appropriate fields from your JSON logs into a dataframe and then publishing that dataframe of events to your Fiddler trial environment. The Lambda function needs to be configured to trigger off of newly created files in your S3 bucket. This makes it a snap to ensure that any time your model makes new inferences, those events will be stored in S3 and will be well on their way to Fiddler to drive the model observability your company needs. To simplify this further, the code for this AWS Lambda function can be accessed by contacting the Fiddler sales team. This code can be quickly tailored to meet the specific needs of your LLM application. You will also need to specify Lambda environment variables so the Lambda function knows how to connect to your Fiddler trial environment, and what the inputs and outputs are within the JSON files being captured by your model. With this Lambda function in place, the logs captured in S3 by your Bedrock FMs will automatically start flowing into your Fiddler environment providing you with world-class LLM observability.  Now that you have Fiddler AI Observability for LLMOps connected in your environment, you have an end-to-end LLMOps workflow spanning from pre-production to production, creating a continuous feedback loop to improve your LLMs. You can further explore the Fiddler platform by validating LLMs and monitoring LLM metrics like hallucination, PII, toxicity and other LLM-specific metrics, analyzing trends and patterns using a 3D UMAP, and gaining insights on how to improve LLMs with better prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques. Create dashboards and reports within Fiddler to share and review with other ML teams and business stakeholders to improve LLM outcomes.  ‍Request a demo to chat with our AI experts.

Meet Danny, a senior solutions engineer at Fiddler fascinated by all the ways machine learning is used, while his hobby slowly takes over his life. I’m a senior solutions engineer at Fiddler. When you boil it down, this role is really about evangelizing the value of Fiddler to our prospects and customers through product demonstrations or evaluations with their own models and data. I have to understand the specifics around customer challenges to ensure they get maximum value from Fiddler. I love building demos! I always have. Demos are easy to build, but finding the datasets to build them from is hard. Datasets that both resonate with customers and appear “real world” are hard to come by and often need to be manufactured.  With a Model Performance Management platform like Fiddler, you want the models showcased during your demos to have “fresh” events (or inferences). It isn’t as interesting to show the platform with dummy data from six months ago. I was lucky enough to build a utility internally that manufactures new inferences for any model we have in our trial or demo environments. With this utility in hand, our Fiddler environments always boast inferences that “just happened” and purposefully introduce interesting things in the data, like drift and integrity violations.This was a really fun project to take on. It was fun to build but now that we have it, it also makes my life easier every day. I love the mission we have at Fiddler to build Responsible AI. Machine Learning, and more broadly AI, is here to stay. We, as human beings, need to put as much focus on the guard rails of the AI systems we build as we do on the systems themselves. Day to day, it is easy to get caught up in the minutiae of our daily tasks. However, when I force myself to take a step back, I am reminded that what we are building is vital to the co-existence of humanity and AI. We must have ways to observe, understand, and ensure no adverse effects from our AI systems. Working with our prospects and customers, I’m always floored at the variety of use cases being tackled by ML. As a result, I think Fiddler always needs to strive to test our platform with the same variety that is being employed by our customers. It’s a tall task to find and incorporate as many of these use cases into our testing suite as possible, but it’s vital to the success of our company and mission.‍ I love spending my recharge days – and evenings, weekends, or any spare moment in between – golfing. I would describe my love of golf as more of a curse than a hobby. It’s crazy to me how I can be borderline miserable and stressed out playing a round of golf, yet the second I walk off of the course all I want to do is go play more. I love the game of golf, but it doesn’t always love me! Good question! I’m not too into sci-fi, but I am still enamored with space. The thought of extraterrestrials is beyond fascinating to me – especially since, statistically speaking, it is pretty much guaranteed that intelligent life outside our planet exists. While not fictional, I suppose I would like to visit another Earth-like planet capable of supporting carbon-based life. Not sure how long I would survive on another planet, but it would be worth every minute. —— Join other brilliant Fiddlers like Danny and help build trust into AI: f</td>\n",

       "      <td>BlogLink:https://www.fiddler.ai/blog/best-practices-for-responsible-ai Content: Our Generative AI Meets Responsible AI summit included a great panel discussion focused on the best practices for responsible AI. The panel was moderated by Fiddler’s own Chief AI Officer and Scientist, Krishnaram Kenthapadi and included these accomplished panelists: Ricardo Baeza-Yates (Director of Research, Institute for Experiential AI Northeastern University), Toni Morgan (Responsible Innovation Manager, TikTok), and Miriam Vogel (President and CEO, EqualAI; Chair, National AI Advisory Committee). We rounded up the top three key takeaways from this panel.  ‍ TAKEAWAY 1 Ricardo Baeza-Yates showed how inaccurate ChatGPT can be by demonstrating inaccuracies found in his biography generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4, including false employment history, awards, and incorrect birth information, notably that GPT 3.5 states that he is deceased. Despite an update to GPT-4, the speaker notes that the new version still contains errors and inconsistencies. He also identified issues with translations into Spanish and Portuguese, observing that the system generates hallucinations by providing different false facts and inconsistencies in these languages. He emphasized the problem of limited language resources, with only a small fraction of the world''s languages having sufficient resources to support AI models like ChatGPT. This issue contributes to the digital divide and exacerbates global inequality, as those who speak less-supported languages face limited access to these tools. Additionally, the inequality in education may worsen due to uneven access to AI tools. Those with the education to use these tools may thrive, while others without access or knowledge may fall further behind. ‍ TAKEAWAY 2 Toni Morgan shared the following insights from their work at Tiktok. AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases and particularly struggles with context, sarcasm, and nuances in languages and cultures,, which may lead to unfair treatment of specific communities. To counter this, teams must work closely together to develop systems that ensure AI fairness and prevent inadvertent impacts on particular groups. When issues arise with the systems'' ability to discern between hateful and reappropriated content, collaboration with content moderation teams is essential. This requires ongoing research, updating community guidelines, and demonstrating commitment to leveling the playing field for all users.  Community guidelines are needed and helpful that cover hate speech, misinformation, and explicit material. However, AI-driven content moderation systems often struggle with understanding context, sarcasm, reappropriation, and nuances in different languages and cultures. Addressing these challenges necessitates diligent work to ensure the right decisions are made in governing content and avoiding incorrect content decisions. Balancing automation with human oversight is a challenge that spans across the industry. While AI-driven systems offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and scalability, relying solely on them for content moderation can lead to unintended consequences. Striking the right balance between automation and human oversight is critical to ensuring that machine learning models and systems minimize model bias while aligning with human values and societal norms.  ‍ TAKEAWAY 3 Miriam Vogel offered these tips: Ensure accountability by designating a C-suite executive responsible for major decisions or issues, providing a clear point of contact. Standardize processes across the enterprise to build trust within the company and among the general public. While external AI regulations are crucial, companies can take internal steps to communicate the trustworthiness of their AI systems. Documentation is a vital aspect of good AI hygiene, including recording testing procedures, frequency, and ensuring the information remains accessible throughout the AI system''s lifespan. Establish regular audits to maintain transparency about testing and its</td>\n",
       "      <td>BlogLink:https://www.fiddler.ai/blog/legal-frontiers-of-ai-with-patrick-hall Content: I had the pleasure to sit down with Patrick Hall from BNH.AI, where he advises clients on AI risk and researches  model risk management for NIST''s AI Risk Management Framework, as well as teaching data ethics and machine learning at The George Washington School of Business. Patrick co-founded BNH and led H2O.ai''s efforts in responsible AI. I had a ton of questions for Patrick and he had more than one spicy take. If you don’t have time to listen to the full interview (but I’m biased and recommend that you do), here are a few takeaways from our discussion. TAKEAWAY 1 Patrick recommends referring to the NIST AI Risk Management framework, which was released in January 2023. There are many responsible AI or trustworthy AI checklists available online, but the most reliable ones tend to come from organizations like NIST and ISO (International Standards Organization). Both NIST and ISO develop different standards, but they work together to ensure alignment. ISO provides extensive checklists for validating machine learning models and ensuring neural network reliability, while NIST focuses more on research and synthesizes that research into guidance. NIST has recently published a comprehensive AI risk management framework, version one, which is one of the best global resources available. Now, on the topic of accountability, there are a few key elements. One direct approach involves explainable AI, which allows for actionable recourse. By explaining how a decision was made and offering a process for appealing that decision, AI systems can become more accountable. This is the most crucial aspect of AI accountability, in my opinion. Another aspect involves internal governance structures, like appointing a chief model risk officer who is solely responsible for AI risk and model governance. This person should be well-compensated, have a large staff and budget, and be independent of the technology organization. Ideally, they would report to the board risk committee and be hired and fired by the board, not the CEO or CTO. TAKEAWAY 2 Patrick shared his opinion that Tesla needs the government and consumers to be confused about the current state of self-driving AI, which is not as good as it''s often portrayed. OpenAI wants their competitors to slow down, as many of them have more funding and personnel. He believes this is the primary reason behind these companies signing such letters. These discussions create noise and divert AI risk management resources toward imagined future catastrophic risks, like the Terminator scenario. Such concerns are considered fake and, in the worst cases, deceitful. Patrick emphasized that we are not close to any Skynet or Terminator scenario, and the intentions of those who advocate for shifting resources in that direction should be questioned. TAKEAWAY 3 Large organizations and individuals often struggle with concepts like AI fairness, privacy, and transparency, as everyone has different expectations regarding these principles. To avoid these challenging issues, incidents — undebatable, negative events that cost money or harm people — can be a useful focus for promoting responsible AI adoption. The AI incident database is an interactive, searchable index containing thousands of public reports on more than 500 known AI and machine learning system failures. The database serves two main purposes: information sharing to prevent repeated incidents and raising public awareness of these failures, possibly discouraging high-risk AI deployments. A prime example of mishandling AI risk is the chatbot released in South Korea in 2021, which started making denigrating comments about various groups of people and had to be shut down. This incident closely mirrored Microsoft''s high-profile Tay chatbot failure. The repetition of such well-known AI incidents indicates the lack of maturity in AI</td>\n",

Meet Danny, a senior solutions engineer at Fiddler fascinated by all the ways machine learning is used, while his hobby slowly takes over his life. I’m a senior solutions engineer at Fiddler. When you boil it down, this role is really about evangelizing the value of Fiddler to our prospects and customers through product demonstrations or evaluations with their own models and data. I have to understand the specifics around customer challenges to ensure they get maximum value from Fiddler. I love building demos! I always have. Demos are easy to build, but finding the datasets to build them from is hard. Datasets that both resonate with customers and appear “real world” are hard to come by and often need to be manufactured.  With a Model Performance Management platform like Fiddler, you want the models showcased during your demos to have “fresh” events (or inferences). It isn’t as interesting to show the platform with dummy data from six months ago. I was lucky enough to build a utility internally that manufactures new inferences for any model we have in our trial or demo environments. With this utility in hand, our Fiddler environments always boast inferences that “just happened” and purposefully introduce interesting things in the data, like drift and integrity violations.This was a really fun project to take on. It was fun to build but now that we have it, it also makes my life easier every day. I love the mission we have at Fiddler to build Responsible AI. Machine Learning, and more broadly AI, is here to stay. We, as human beings, need to put as much focus on the guard rails of the AI systems we build as we do on the systems themselves. Day to day, it is easy to get caught up in the minutiae of our daily tasks. However, when I force myself to take a step back, I am reminded that what we are building is vital to the co-existence of humanity and AI. We must have ways to observe, understand, and ensure no adverse effects from our AI systems. Working with our prospects and customers, I’m always floored at the variety of use cases being tackled by ML. As a result, I think Fiddler always needs to strive to test our platform with the same variety that is being employed by our customers. It’s a tall task to find and incorporate as many of these use cases into our testing suite as possible, but it’s vital to the success of our company and mission.‍ I love spending my recharge days – and evenings, weekends, or any spare moment in between – golfing. I would describe my love of golf as more of a curse than a hobby. It’s crazy to me how I can be borderline miserable and stressed out playing a round of golf, yet the second I walk off of the course all I want to do is go play more. I love the game of golf, but it doesn’t always love me! Good question! I’m not too into sci-fi, but I am still enamored with space. The thought of extraterrestrials is beyond fascinating to me – especially since, statistically speaking, it is pretty much guaranteed that intelligent life outside our planet exists. While not fictional, I suppose I would like to visit another Earth-like planet capable of supporting carbon-based life. Not sure how long I would survive on another planet, but it would be worth every minute. —— Join other brilliant Fiddlers like Danny and help build trust into AI: f   \n",

       "486  BlogLink:https://www.fiddler.ai/blog/best-practices-for-responsible-ai Content: Our Generative AI Meets Responsible AI summit included a great panel discussion focused on the best practices for responsible AI. The panel was moderated by Fiddler’s own Chief AI Officer and Scientist, Krishnaram Kenthapadi and included these accomplished panelists: Ricardo Baeza-Yates (Director of Research, Institute for Experiential AI Northeastern University), Toni Morgan (Responsible Innovation Manager, TikTok), and Miriam Vogel (President and CEO, EqualAI; Chair, National AI Advisory Committee). We rounded up the top three key takeaways from this panel.  ‍ TAKEAWAY 1 Ricardo Baeza-Yates showed how inaccurate ChatGPT can be by demonstrating inaccuracies found in his biography generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT-4, including false employment history, awards, and incorrect birth information, notably that GPT 3.5 states that he is deceased. Despite an update to GPT-4, the speaker notes that the new version still contains errors and inconsistencies. He also identified issues with translations into Spanish and Portuguese, observing that the system generates hallucinations by providing different false facts and inconsistencies in these languages. He emphasized the problem of limited language resources, with only a small fraction of the world''s languages having sufficient resources to support AI models like ChatGPT. This issue contributes to the digital divide and exacerbates global inequality, as those who speak less-supported languages face limited access to these tools. Additionally, the inequality in education may worsen due to uneven access to AI tools. Those with the education to use these tools may thrive, while others without access or knowledge may fall further behind. ‍ TAKEAWAY 2 Toni Morgan shared the following insights from their work at Tiktok. AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases and particularly struggles with context, sarcasm, and nuances in languages and cultures,, which may lead to unfair treatment of specific communities. To counter this, teams must work closely together to develop systems that ensure AI fairness and prevent inadvertent impacts on particular groups. When issues arise with the systems'' ability to discern between hateful and reappropriated content, collaboration with content moderation teams is essential. This requires ongoing research, updating community guidelines, and demonstrating commitment to leveling the playing field for all users.  Community guidelines are needed and helpful that cover hate speech, misinformation, and explicit material. However, AI-driven content moderation systems often struggle with understanding context, sarcasm, reappropriation, and nuances in different languages and cultures. Addressing these challenges necessitates diligent work to ensure the right decisions are made in governing content and avoiding incorrect content decisions. Balancing automation with human oversight is a challenge that spans across the industry. While AI-driven systems offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and scalability, relying solely on them for content moderation can lead to unintended consequences. Striking the right balance between automation and human oversight is critical to ensuring that machine learning models and systems minimize model bias while aligning with human values and societal norms.  ‍ TAKEAWAY 3 Miriam Vogel offered these tips: Ensure accountability by designating a C-suite executive responsible for major decisions or issues, providing a clear point of contact. Standardize processes across the enterprise to build trust within the company and among the general public. While external AI regulations are crucial, companies can take internal steps to communicate the trustworthiness of their AI systems.

Lastly, before you can start publishing LLM conversations into Fiddler for observability, you need to onboard a “model” that represents the inputs, outputs and metadata used by your LLM application. Let’s first create a model_info object which contains the schema for your application.Fiddler will create the embeddings for our unstructured inputs, like query, response and the source documents passed to our Bedrock FM retrieved via RAG. Fiddler offers a variety of “enrichments” that can flag your LLM-applications for potential safety issues like hallucinations, toxicity, and PII leakage. Additionally, you can pass any other metadata to Fiddler like end user feedback (likes/dislikes), FM costs, FM latencies, and source documents from the RAG-retrieval.You’ll note in the model_info object below, we’re defining the primary features as the query and the response, as well as a list of metadata we will be tracking too — some passed to Fiddler like docs, feedback, cost and latency and some calculated by Fiddler like toxicity and PII leakage. Then, you can onboard the LLM application “model” using your new model_info object. After this onboarding, you should see the schema of your LLM application in Fiddler like so: Using the simple-to-deploy serverless architecture of AWS Lambda, you can quickly build the mechanism required to move the logging from your Bedrock FMs from the S3 bucket (setup in step 1 above), into your newly provisioned Fiddler trial environment. This Lambda function will be responsible for opening any new JSON event log files in your model’s S3 bucket, parsing and formatting the appropriate fields from your JSON logs into a dataframe and then publishing that dataframe of events to your Fiddler trial environment. The Lambda function needs to be configured to trigger off of newly created files in your S3 bucket. This makes it a snap to ensure that any time your model makes new inferences, those events will be stored in S3 and will be well on their way to Fiddler to drive the model observability your company needs. To simplify this further, the code for this AWS Lambda function can be accessed by contacting the Fiddler sales team. This code can be quickly tailored to meet the specific needs of your LLM application. You will also need to specify Lambda environment variables so the Lambda function knows how to connect to your Fiddler trial environment, and what the inputs and outputs are within the JSON files being captured by your model. With this Lambda function in place, the logs captured in S3 by your Bedrock FMs will automatically start flowing into your Fiddler environment providing you with world-class LLM observability.  Now that you have Fiddler AI Observability for LLMOps connected in your environment, you have an end-to-end LLMOps workflow spanning from pre-production to production, creating a continuous feedback loop to improve your LLMs. You can further explore the Fiddler platform by validating LLMs and monitoring LLM metrics like hallucination, PII, toxicity and other LLM-specific metrics, analyzing trends and patterns using a 3D UMAP, and gaining insights on how to improve LLMs with better prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques.

       "486  BlogLink:https://www.fiddler.ai/blog/legal-frontiers-of-ai-with-patrick-hall Content: I had the pleasure to sit down with Patrick Hall from BNH.AI, where he advises clients on AI risk and researches  model risk management for NIST''s AI Risk Management Framework, as well as teaching data ethics and machine learning at The George Washington School of Business. Patrick co-founded BNH and led H2O.ai''s efforts in responsible AI. I had a ton of questions for Patrick and he had more than one spicy take. If you don’t have time to listen to the full interview (but I’m biased and recommend that you do), here are a few takeaways from our discussion. TAKEAWAY 1 Patrick recommends referring to the NIST AI Risk Management framework, which was released in January 2023. There are many responsible AI or trustworthy AI checklists available online, but the most reliable ones tend to come from organizations like NIST and ISO (International Standards Organization). Both NIST and ISO develop different standards, but they work together to ensure alignment. ISO provides extensive checklists for validating machine learning models and ensuring neural network reliability, while NIST focuses more on research and synthesizes that research into guidance. NIST has recently published a comprehensive AI risk management framework, version one, which is one of the best global resources available. Now, on the topic of accountability, there are a few key elements. One direct approach involves explainable AI, which allows for actionable recourse. By explaining how a decision was made and offering a process for appealing that decision, AI systems can become more accountable. This is the most crucial aspect of AI accountability, in my opinion. Another aspect involves internal governance structures, like appointing a chief model risk officer who is solely responsible for AI risk and model governance. This person should be well-compensated, have a large staff and budget, and be independent of the technology organization. Ideally, they would report to the board risk committee and be hired and fired by the board, not the CEO or CTO. TAKEAWAY 2 Patrick shared his opinion that Tesla needs the government and consumers to be confused about the current state of self-driving AI, which is not as good as it''s often portrayed. OpenAI wants their competitors to slow down, as many of them have more funding and personnel. He believes this is the primary reason behind these companies signing such letters. These discussions create noise and divert AI risk management resources toward imagined future catastrophic risks, like the Terminator scenario. Such concerns are considered fake and, in the worst cases, deceitful. Patrick emphasized that we are not close to any Skynet or Terminator scenario, and the intentions of those who advocate for shifting resources in that direction should be questioned. TAKEAWAY 3 Large organizations and individuals often struggle with concepts like AI fairness, privacy, and transparency, as everyone has different expectations regarding these principles. To avoid these challenging issues, incidents — undebatable, negative events that cost money or harm people — can be a useful focus for promoting responsible AI adoption. The AI incident database is an interactive, searchable index containing thousands of public reports on more than 500 known AI and machine learning system failures. The database serves two main purposes: information sharing to prevent repeated incidents and raising public awareness of these failures, possibly discouraging high-risk AI deployments. A prime example of mishandling AI risk is the chatbot released in South Korea in 2021, which started making denigrating comments about various groups of people and had to be shut down. This incident closely mirrored Microsoft''s high-profile Tay chatbot failure. The repetition of such well-known AI incidents indicates the lack of maturity in AI   \n",
